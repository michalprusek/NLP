Exemplar:
Example 1:
Q: Carly recently graduated and is looking for work in a field she studied for. She sent 200 job applications to companies in her state, and twice that number to companies in other states. Calculate the total number of job applications she has sent so far.
A: If she sent 200 job applications to her state, she sent 200*2 = <<200*2=400>>400 job applications to other states.
The total number of job applications she has sent is 400+200 = <<400+200=600>>600

Example 2:
Q: Turner wants to ride the rollercoaster 3 times, the Catapult 2 times and the Ferris wheel once. It costs 4 tickets to ride the rollercoaster, 4 tickets to ride the Catapult and 1 ticket to ride the Ferris wheel. How many tickets does Turner need?
A: The number of tickets needed for the rollercoaster is 3 rides × 4 tickets/ride = <<3*4=12>>12 tickets.
The number of tickets needed for the Catapult is 2 rides × 4 tickets/ride = <<2*4=8>>8 tickets.
The number of tickets needed for the Ferris wheel is 1 ride × 1 ticket/ride = <<1*1=1>>1 ticket.
Turner needs 12 tickets + 8 tickets + 1 tickets = <<12+8+1=21>>21 tickets.

Example 3:
Q: Joanna has $8. Compared to her money, her brother has thrice as much while her sister has only half as much. How much money do the three of them have altogether?
A: Joanna has $<<8=8>>8.
Joanna's brother has thrice as much as Joanna, so he has $8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
Her sister has half as much as Joanna, then she has $8/2 = $<<8/2=4>>4.
Together they have $8 + $24 + $4 = $<<8+24+4=36>>36 altogether.

Example 4:
Q: Noah and Ava are planning a trip to the zoo.  Zoo entry tickets are $5 per person.  Bus fare is $1.50 per person one way.  If they bring $40 with them, how much money do they have left to spend on lunch and snacks?
A: Noah and Ava’s zoo entry tickets are $5 x 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.
Their round trip bus fare will be $1.50 x 2 x 2 = $<<1.5*2*2=6>>6.
Zoo tickets and bus fare will cost $10 + $6 = $<<10+6=16>>16.
For lunch and snacks, they will have $40 - $16 = $<<40-16=24>>24.

Example 5:
Q: Carla is taking attendance for her sixth-grade class. She knows that 2 students are in the restroom, and one less than three times that number of students are absent. If there are four rows with six desks each that are all 2/3 full, how many students does Carla teach, including the ones in and out of the classroom?
A: First find the number of absent students: 2 students * 3 - 1= <<2*3-1=5>>5 students
Now find the number of students in each row of desks: 6 desks/row * 2 students / 3 desks = 4 students/row
Now find the number of students in all the rows: 4 rows * 4 students/row = <<4*4=16>>16 students
Now add the students that are absent or in the bathroom: 16 students + 2 students + 5 students = <<16+2+5=23>>23 students
