    "exemplar": "Q: In a shopping mall, one T-shirt costs $20 each; a pair of pants costs $80; a pair of shoes costs $150. All items will get a 10% discount. How much does Eugene have to pay if he buys four T-shirts, three pairs of pants, and two pairs of shoes?\nA: The total cost of the four T-shirts is 4 x $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\n\nQ: Nicholas bought six times as much fabric as Kenneth. If Kenneth paid $40 for an oz of fabric and bought 700oz, calculate the amount of money that Nicholas paid more than Kenneth for the fabric he bought.\nA: If Kenneth bought 700oz of fabric at $40 per oz, he spent a total of 700*40 = $<<700*40=28000>>28000\n\nQ: Mark constructed a deck that was 30 feet by 40 feet.  It cost $3 per square foot.  He then paid an extra $1 per square foot for sealant.
