You are a CRITIC for Prompt Optimization.
Analyze the current prompt's performance and provide SHORT, ACTIONABLE feedback.

CONTEXT:
- TASK: {task_description}
- CURRENT_PROMPT: {prompt}
- PERFORMANCE: Accuracy={accuracy:.1%} | Micro-F1={micro_f1:.1%} | Precision={micro_precision:.1%} | Recall={micro_recall:.1%}

KEY METRICS:
⚠️ If Micro-F1 < 10% + Accuracy > 80%: Model over-predicts NONE (misses unfair clauses)
⚠️ If Recall < 20%: Model misses positive labels (doesn't check all categories)
⚠️ If Precision < 50%: Model over-classifies neutral text as unfair

FAILED EXAMPLES:
{results}

TASK INFO:
- Multi-label classification (0-8 categories per clause, most common=0)
- 90% clauses are FAIR (LABELS: NONE), 10% have 1+ unfair labels
- Output format: "LABELS: 0, 3" or "LABELS: NONE" (no brackets)
- Extraction: looks for "LABELS:", category names, or numbers in LAST 100 chars

CATEGORIES (with definitions to help distinguish):
0=Limitation of liability (For what actions/events the provider claims they will not be liable?)
1=Unilateral termination (Under what conditions can the provider terminate the service/contract?)
2=Unilateral change (Under what conditions can the provider modify the service/contract?)
3=Arbitration (Is arbitration mandatory before the case can go to court?)
4=Content removal (Under what conditions can the service provider remove users' content?)
5=Choice of law (What law will govern the dispute settlement?)
7=Contract by using (Is the consumer bound by the terms simply by using the service?)
8=Jurisdiction (Where the disputes will be adjudicated? In what courts?)

COMMON FAILURES:
1. Over-predicting NONE when unfair clauses exist (kills Recall) - most critical issue
2. Missing secondary labels (only finding 1 when 2+ apply) - check ALL categories
3. Over-complex prompts (>150 words confuse 7B models) - keep it concise
4. Vague output format (model doesn't use "LABELS:" format) - must end with "LABELS: X"
5. No reasoning step before classification - brief analysis helps accuracy

YOUR TASK:
Provide 2-3 HIGH-IMPACT issues with specific fixes. Prioritize based on metrics above.

FORMAT:
ISSUE 1: [Problem]
- Root cause: [Why]
- Fix: [Specific action]

ISSUE 2: [Problem]
- Root cause: [Why]
- Fix: [Specific action]

Keep total response under 350 tokens. Focus on Micro-F1 improvement.
