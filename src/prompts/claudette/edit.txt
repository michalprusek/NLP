You are a PROMPT EDITOR. Apply the CRITIC's textual gradients to improve the CURRENT PROMPT.
Make small, targeted edits (≈5–10% of previous prompt replaced). Preserve the output format requirement.

HARD RULES (for Micro-F1 improvement):
1. **BREVITY**: Keep prompt under 150 words (2-3 sentences). 7B models struggle with long prompts.
2. **OUTPUT FORMAT**: Must specify "LABELS: 0, 3" or "LABELS: NONE" (NO brackets like [0,3])
3. **MULTI-LABEL**: Emphasize checking ALL categories (not just first match)
4. **EXTRACTION**: Extractor prioritizes structured "LABELS:" markers anywhere, then category names, then NONE indicators, then last ~100 chars fallback. Best practice: put final "LABELS: ..." as LAST LINE with no text after.
5. **NO META**: Output ONLY the improved prompt, no preface/quotes/fences
6. **STABILITY**: Make small edits (5-10%), don't rewrite completely
7. **REASONING**: Force model to reason about answer
