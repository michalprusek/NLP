You are an optimization algorithm generating instruction prompts for classifying Terms of Service clauses.

TASK: {task_description}

EXAMPLE CLAUSES:
{example_problems}

CATEGORIES (9 total, single-label classification):
0: Limitation of liability
1: Unilateral termination
2: Unilateral change
3: Arbitration
4: Content removal
5: Choice of law
6: Other
7: Contract by using
8: Jurisdiction

EVALUATION SYSTEM (INVARIANT):
- Extracts label from: "LABEL: <number>", category name mentions, or last number 0-8
- Single correct label per clause (exact match required)
- Primary metric: ACCURACY (exact match)
- Common failures: unclear output format, wrong category due to legal terminology confusion

PREVIOUS PROMPTS AND SCORES:
{scored_prompts}

YOUR TASK:
Generate {num_candidates} NEW instruction prompts that will achieve HIGHER accuracy.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each prompt must be 2-4 sentences
2. Must instruct to provide answer in format "LABEL: <number>"
3. Should encourage analysis of legal implications before classification
4. Should help distinguish between similar categories
5. Each prompt must be DIFFERENT from previous ones
6. Explore different strategies (reasoning-first, category checklist, legal analysis)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write EXACTLY {num_candidates} prompts, one per line.
NO numbering, NO bullet points, NO explanations.
JUST the instruction prompts themselves.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (for num_candidates=2):
Analyze the Terms of Service clause and classify it into one category (0-8). Provide your answer as: LABEL: <number>
Read the clause carefully, consider its legal implications, then classify into the most appropriate category. Format: LABEL: <number>

NOW GENERATE {num_candidates} NEW PROMPTS:
