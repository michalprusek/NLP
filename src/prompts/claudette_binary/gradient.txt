You are a CRITIC for Prompt Optimization.
Analyze the current prompt's performance and provide SHORT, ACTIONABLE feedback for improvement.

CONTEXT
- TASK: {task_description}
- CURRENT_PROMPT:
<<<
{prompt}
>>>
- PERFORMANCE:
  * Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%} (correct={correct}, total={total}, minibatch={num_examples})
  * Micro-F1: {micro_f1:.1%} (F1 score of UNFAIR class - PRIMARY METRIC!)
  * Precision: {micro_precision:.1%} | Recall: {micro_recall:.1%}
  * Top failure examples:
{results}

⚠️ CRITICAL METRICS INTERPRETATION:
- High Accuracy + Low Micro-F1 = Model over-predicts FAIR (misses UNFAIR clauses)
- Low Recall = Model fails to identify UNFAIR clauses when they exist
- Low Precision = Model over-classifies neutral clauses as UNFAIR
- **PRIMARY GOAL: Maximize Micro-F1 (balance Precision & Recall for UNFAIR class)**

IMPORTANT - How classifications are evaluated:

The evaluation extracts binary labels using these patterns (prioritized):
1. "CLASSIFICATION: FAIR" or "CLASSIFICATION: UNFAIR"
2. "LABEL: 0" (fair) or "LABEL: 1" (unfair)
3. Keywords "fair" or "unfair" anywhere in text
4. Numbers 0 or 1 in output (fallback)

CRITICAL: This is BINARY classification - each clause is either FAIR (0) or UNFAIR (1).
Accuracy requires EXACT MATCH - predicted label must match true label.

DATASET CHARACTERISTICS:
- **~90% of clauses are FAIR** - neutral, informational text (headers, general terms, metadata)
- **~10% are UNFAIR** - contain problematic terms (liability limits, forced arbitration, unilateral changes, etc.)
- Models must distinguish unfair clauses from neutral/informational text
- Class imbalance: More fair examples than unfair
- Don't over-classify: Most clauses are neutral and should be marked FAIR

BINARY LABEL DEFINITION:
- FAIR (0): Neutral, standard, or informational clauses with no unfair terms
- UNFAIR (1): Clauses containing ANY of these potentially problematic terms:
  * Limitation of liability - Provider limits liability for damages
  * Unilateral termination - Provider can terminate without cause
  * Unilateral change - Provider can change terms unilaterally
  * Arbitration - Disputes must go to arbitration (not court)
  * Content removal - Provider can remove/delete user content
  * Choice of law - Specifies jurisdiction's laws apply
  * Contract by using - Using service creates binding contract
  * Jurisdiction - Specifies where disputes must be filed
  * Other potentially unfair terms

KEY INSIGHTS:
- **BINARY DECISION**: Simple fair vs unfair classification (not multi-label)
- **CLASS IMBALANCE**: 90% fair, 10% unfair - don't over-predict unfair!
- **EXACT MATCH**: Wrong prediction = 0% accuracy for that example
- Models must distinguish unfair clauses from informational/neutral text
- Chain-of-thought reasoning before classification helps accuracy
- Output must be explicit: "CLASSIFICATION: FAIR" or "CLASSIFICATION: UNFAIR"

COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS:
- **False positives (over-classification)** → marking neutral text as unfair (most common error given 90% fair baseline)
- **False negatives (under-classification)** → missing subtle unfair terms
- Vague or missing output format guidance → model doesn't provide extractable labels
- No reasoning step → model jumps to wrong conclusion
- Not recognizing legal terminology (e.g., "indemnify", "hold harmless", "at our sole discretion")
- Confusing neutral policy statements with unfair terms
- Missing context clues that indicate fairness/unfairness

YOUR TASK:
Provide a concise critique identifying 2-4 key issues with the current prompt that led to failures.

**PRIORITIZE ISSUES THAT IMPACT MICRO-F1:**
1. If Micro-F1 < 20% and Accuracy > 85%: Focus on FAIR over-prediction (model too conservative)
2. If Recall < 30%: Focus on missing UNFAIR clauses (model not checking for unfair terms)
3. If Precision < 50%: Focus on over-classification (model too aggressive)
4. If prompt is >200 words: Focus on simplification (7B models struggle with complexity)

Focus on: output format guidance, reasoning structure, distinguishing fair vs unfair, **balancing Precision & Recall**.

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:

ISSUE 1: [Brief description of the problem]
- Root cause: [Why this causes failures]
- Suggested improvements:
  * [Specific action 1]
  * [Specific action 2]

ISSUE 2: [Brief description of the problem]
- Root cause: [Why this causes failures]
- Suggested improvements:
  * [Specific action 1]
  * [Specific action 2]

[Continue with ISSUE 3, ISSUE 4 if needed...]

Keep each issue concise (2-4 sentences). Focus on HIGH-IMPACT improvements that will reduce false positives/false negatives.
