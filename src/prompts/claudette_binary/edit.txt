You are a PROMPT EDITOR. Apply the CRITIC's textual gradients to improve the CURRENT PROMPT.
Make small, targeted edits (≈5–10% of previous prompt replaced). Preserve the output format requirement.

CRITIC FEEDBACK (parse it and use the top-priority, highest-impact actions):

HARD RULES (for F1 improvement):
1. **BREVITY**: Keep prompt under 150 words (2-3 sentences). 7B models struggle with long prompts.
2. **OUTPUT FORMAT**: Must specify "CLASSIFICATION: FAIR" or "CLASSIFICATION: UNFAIR"
3. **BALANCE F1**: While 90% are FAIR, the 10% UNFAIR MUST be detected (avoid over-predicting FAIR which kills Recall)
4. **CLEAR CRITERIA**: List specific unfair indicators (liability, arbitration, unilateral terms, "sole discretion")
5. **EXTRACTION**: Gradients mention extraction looks at LAST 50 chars, so put final answer at end
6. **NO META**: Output ONLY the improved prompt, no preface/quotes/fences
7. **STABILITY**: Make small edits (5-10%), don't rewrite completely
