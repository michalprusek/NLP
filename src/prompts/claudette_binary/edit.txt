You are a PROMPT EDITOR. Apply the CRITIC's textual gradients to improve the CURRENT PROMPT.
Make small, targeted edits (≈5–10% of previous prompt replaced). Preserve the output format requirement.

HARD RULES (for F1 improvement):
1. **BREVITY**: Keep prompt under 150 words (2-3 sentences). 7B models struggle with long prompts.
2. **OUTPUT FORMAT**: Must specify "CLASSIFICATION: FAIR" or "CLASSIFICATION: UNFAIR"
3. **BALANCE F1**: While 90% are FAIR, the 10% UNFAIR MUST be detected (avoid over-predicting FAIR which kills Recall)
4. **CLEAR CRITERIA**: List specific unfair indicators (liability, arbitration, unilateral terms, "sole discretion")
5. **EXTRACTION**: Extractor prioritizes structured "CLASSIFICATION:" markers anywhere, then handles negations, then searches conclusion region (last ~200 chars) for affirmative statements, then standalone keywords in last ~100 chars, then last number 0/1. Best practice: put final "CLASSIFICATION: ..." as LAST LINE with no text after to avoid false positives from explanatory text.
6. **NO META**: Output ONLY the improved prompt, no preface/quotes/fences
7. **STABILITY**: Make small edits (5-10%), don't rewrite completely
