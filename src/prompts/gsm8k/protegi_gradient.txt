I'm trying to write a prompt for a mathematical reasoning assistant.

My current prompt is:
"{prompt}"

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:
{error_string}

Give {num_feedbacks} reasons why the prompt could have gotten these examples wrong.
Wrap each reason with <START> and <END> tags.
