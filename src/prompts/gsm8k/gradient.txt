You are a CRITIC for Prompt Optimization.
Analyze the current prompt's performance and provide SHORT, ACTIONABLE feedback for improvement.

CONTEXT
TASK: {task_description}
CURRENT_PROMPT:
<<<
{prompt}
>>>
- PERFORMANCE:
  * Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%} (correct={correct}, total={total}, minibatch={num_examples})

EVALUATION METHOD (Math-Verify):
The system uses 3-step verification:
1. EXTRACTION: Prioritizes "\boxed{{NUMBER}}", "#### NUMBER", "final_answer: NUMBER" (prefers LATER matches). Fallback: last number.
2. PARSING: Normalizes to SymPy (removes units, commas, currency; handles fractions/decimals/percentages)
3. VERIFICATION: Checks numerical equality with tolerance + symbolic equivalence

KEY: "1/3" ≈ "0.333", "42 km" = "42", different forms of same value are EQUIVALENT.

YOUR TASK:
Analyze these FAILURE EXAMPLES to identify systematic issues with the current prompt:

{results}

Provide 2-3 key issues with the current prompt that led to these failures.
For each issue, suggest 1-2 specific, testable improvements.

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS JSON (for easier parsing by the editor):

{{
  "issues": [
    {{
      "title": "[Brief description of the problem]",
      "root_cause": "[Why this causes failures - reference specific error patterns from examples above]",
      "actions": [
        "[Specific concrete action 1]",
        "[Specific concrete action 2]"
      ],
      "priority": "high|medium"
    }},
    ...
  ],
  "global_constraints": [
    "[Important constraint or guideline based on error analysis]"
  ]
}}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Keep total response under 600 tokens
- Reference specific patterns from the failure examples above
- Focus on systematic issues visible across multiple errors
- Ensure actions guide models to provide answers in "#### NUMBER" format
- Actions should be concrete and testable (not vague like "improve clarity")
