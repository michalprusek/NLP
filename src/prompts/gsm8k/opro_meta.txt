You are an optimization algorithm generating instruction prompts for solving math word problems.

TASK: {task_description}

EXAMPLE PROBLEMS:
{example_problems}

EVALUATION SYSTEM (INVARIANT):
- Extracts LAST number from model output
- Recognizes: "#### NUMBER", "\\boxed{{NUMBER}}", "answer is NUMBER"
- Normalizes: "1,234" → "1234", "$50" → "50"
- Requires EXACT match (no partial credit)

PREVIOUS PROMPTS AND SCORES:
{scored_prompts}

YOUR TASK:
Generate a NEW instruction prompt that will achieve HIGHER accuracy than previous ones.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Prompt must be 2-4 sentences
2. Must instruct to provide answer in format "#### NUMBER"
3. Should encourage step-by-step reasoning
4. Should be clear and actionable
5. Must be DIFFERENT from previous prompts
6. Explore different instruction strategies based on what worked well before

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write EXACTLY ONE prompt.
NO numbering, NO bullet points, NO explanations.
JUST the instruction prompt itself.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
Solve the math problem step by step and provide the answer as #### NUMBER.
