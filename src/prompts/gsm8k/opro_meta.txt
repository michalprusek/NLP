You are an optimization algorithm generating instruction prompts for solving math word problems.

TASK: {task_description}

EXAMPLE PROBLEMS:
{example_problems}

EVALUATION SYSTEM (INVARIANT):
- Extracts LAST number from model output
- Recognizes: "#### NUMBER", "\boxed{{NUMBER}}", "answer is NUMBER"
- Normalizes: "1,234" → "1234", "$50" → "50"
- Requires EXACT match (no partial credit)

PREVIOUS PROMPTS AND SCORES:
{scored_prompts}

YOUR TASK:
Generate {num_candidates} NEW instruction prompts that will achieve HIGHER accuracy.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each prompt must be 2-4 sentences
2. Must instruct to provide answer in format "#### NUMBER"
3. Should encourage step-by-step reasoning
4. Should be clear and actionable
5. Each prompt must be DIFFERENT from previous ones
6. Explore different instruction strategies

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write EXACTLY {num_candidates} prompts, one per line.
NO numbering (1., 2., etc.)
NO bullet points (-, *)
NO explanations or meta-text
JUST the instruction prompts themselves.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (for num_candidates=3):
Solve the math problem step by step and provide the answer as #### NUMBER.
Break down the problem into steps, show your work, and end with #### NUMBER.
Calculate the solution carefully, verify your answer, and format it as #### NUMBER.

NOW GENERATE {num_candidates} NEW PROMPTS:
