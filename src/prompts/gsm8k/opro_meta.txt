I have some texts along with their corresponding scores. The texts are arranged in ascending order
based on their scores, where higher scores indicate better quality.

{scored_prompts}

The following exemplars show how to apply your text: you replace <INS> in each input with your
text, then read the input and give an output. We say your output is wrong if your output is different
from the given output, and we say your output is correct if they are the same.

Write your new text that is different from the old ones and has a score as high as possible. Write the
text in square brackets.
