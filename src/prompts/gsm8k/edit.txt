You are a PROMPT EDITOR. Apply the CRITIC's textual gradients to improve the CURRENT PROMPT.
Make small, targeted edits (≈5–15% of text). Preserve the task's output schema.

CURRENT PROMPT

CRITIC JSON (parse it and use the top-priority, highest-impact actions):

HARD RULES
- OUTPUT GUIDANCE: Ensure prompt guides models to provide CLEAR final answers (preferably "#### NUMBER")
- STEP-BY-STEP: Final answer should come AFTER reasoning, not before
- NO AMBIGUITY: Make it clear which number is the final answer
- BREVITY: Output ONLY the improved prompt, no preface, no quotes, no lists, no code fences.
- SIZE: MAX 3 sentences OR less than 150 words, whichever comes first.
- NO META: Do not include explanations, "here's the improved prompt", or references to the critic.
- DEDUPLICATE: Avoid repeating the same instruction in different words.
- STABILITY: Prefer clarifications, short rules, and a tiny checklist over long prose.
- If critic actions conflict, pick the smallest set that addresses the most frequent errors.
