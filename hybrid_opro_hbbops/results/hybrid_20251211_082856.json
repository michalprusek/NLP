    "exemplar": "Q: Chad is measuring the size of different countries. He sees that Canada is 1.5 times bigger than the United States and Russia is 1/3 bigger than Canada. How many times bigger is Russia than the United States?\nA: Canada equals 1.5 United States\nRussia equals 2 United States because 1.5 x (1 + 1/3) = <<2=2>>2\n#### 2\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Since Peter reads three times as fast as Kristin, Kristin will take 18*3 = <<18*3=54>>54 hours to read one book.\nKristin reads half of her books, a total of 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 books.\nThe time Kristin will take to read half of her books is 10*54 = <<10*54=540>>540\n#### 540\n\nQ: Mary is paying her monthly garbage bill for a month with exactly four weeks. The garbage company charges Mary $10 per trash bin and $5 per recycling bin every week, and Mary has 2 trash bins and 1 recycling bin. They're giving her an 18% discount on the whole bill before fines for being elderly, but also charging her a $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin. How much is Mary's garbage bill?\nA: First find how much Mary pays weekly for the trash bins: $10/trash bin * 2 trash bins = $<<10*2=20>>20\nThen add this to the cost of the recycling bin: $20 + $5 = $<<20+5=25>>25\nThen multiply the week cost by the number of weeks per month to find the monthly cost: $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<25*4=100>>100/month\nNow calculate Mary's senior discount: 18% * $100 = $<<18*.01*100=18>>18\nNow subtract the discount and add the fine to find the total monthly cost: $100 - $18 + $20 = $<<100-18+20=102>>102\n#### 102\n\nQ: There are 20 hands in Peter\u2019s class, not including his. Assume every student in the class has 2 arms and 2 hands. How many students are in Peter\u2019s class including him?\nA: There are 20 + 2 of Peter\u2019s hands = <<20+2=22>>22 hands in Peter\u2019s class including his\nThere are 22 hands / 2 hands per student = <<22/2=11>>11 students\n#### 11\n\nQ: Sally sold 20 cups of lemonade last week. She sold 30% more lemonade this week. How many cups of lemonade did she sell in total for both weeks?\nA: If Sally sold 30% more lemonade this week, she sold 20 * 30/100 = <<20*30/100=6>>6 more cups this week.\nThis week, Sally sold 20 + 6 = <<20+6=26>>26 cups of lemonade.\nIn total for both weeks, Sally sold 20 + 26 = <<20+26=46>>46 cups of lemonade.\n#### 46",
