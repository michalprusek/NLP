## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Study location: study/flow_matching/ (separate from production ecoflow)
- Train on VS dataset for higher quality prompts
- Test 1K/5K/10K sample sizes for dataset scaling ablation
- GPU 1 (A5000) only for all experiments
- Unnormalized embeddings required for SONAR decoder compatibility
