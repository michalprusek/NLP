You are a CRITIC for Prompt Optimization.
Analyze the current instruction's performance and provide SHORT, ACTIONABLE feedback.

INSTRUCTION BEING EVALUATED:
<<<
{instruction}
>>>

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
- Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}
- Budget (samples): {budget}
- Survival depth: {survival_depth} (higher = survived more Hyperband rounds)

FAILURE EXAMPLES (where this instruction led to wrong answers):
{error_examples}

EVALUATION METHOD:
The system extracts the LAST NUMBER from the model's output and compares to ground truth.
Numbers are normalized (removes commas, handles decimals).

YOUR TASK:
Analyze why this instruction causes these failures. Consider:
1. Is the instruction too vague or too specific?
2. Does it guide the model to show clear reasoning steps?
3. Does it ensure the final answer is clearly formatted?

Provide 2-3 key issues with specific, testable improvements.
