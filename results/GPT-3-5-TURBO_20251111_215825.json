There will be three rounds of layoffs. For each round of layoff, 10% of the remaining employees will be laid off. How many employees will be laid off in total?\nA: <INS>\nGround truth answer: The first round will result in 1000 * 10% = <<1000*10*.01=100>>100 employee layoffs.\nThere are 1000 - 100 = <<1000-100=900>>900 employees remaining.\nThe second round will result in 900 * 10% = <<900*10*.01=90>>90 employee layoffs.\nThere are 900 - 90 = <<900-90=810>>810 employees remaining.\nThe third round will result in 810 * 10% = <<810*10*.01=81>>81 employee layoffs.\nThe total number of of employees laid off is 100 + 90 + 81 = <<100+90+81=271>>271.\n#### 271\n\nProblem:\nQ: Tom decides to renovate a house.  There are 3 bedrooms and each bedroom takes 4 hours to renovate.  The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom.  The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined.  How long did everything take?\nA: <INS>\nGround truth answer: The kitchen took 4 * .5 = <<4*.5=2>>2 hours longer than the bedrooms\nSo the kitchen took 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours\nThe bedrooms took 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 hours\nSo the kitchen and bedrooms combined took 12 + 6 = <<12+6=18>>18 hours\nThe living room took 18 * 2 = <<18*2=36>>36 hours\nSo everything took a total of 18 + 36 = <<18+36=54>>54 hours\n#### 54\n\nProblem:\nQ: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes.

Her essay is due at midnight. She writes 400 words per hour for the first two hours. After that, she writes 200 words per hour. How many hours before the deadline does she need to start to finish on time?\nA: <INS>\nGround truth answer: In the first two hours, Keenan writes 800 words because 400*2=<<400*2=800>>800.\nAfter that, she still needs to write 400 words because 1200-800=<<1200-800=400>>400.\nSince she writes 200 words per hour, she will take 2 hours to write the last 400 words because 400/200=<<400/200=2>>2.\nThus, she needs to start 4 hours before the deadline because 2+2=<<4=4>>4.\n#### 4\n\nProblem:\nQ: Sally is saving up for a trip to Sea World.

How much would it cost Fred to buy enough sodas for every guest to have 2 cans?\nA: <INS>\nGround truth answer: He planned on 2 sodas per guest and invited 15 guests so 2*15 =<<2*15=30>>30 cans of soda\nEach pack of soda had 6 cans. He needed to buy 30 cans of soda for his guest so 30/6 = <<30/6=5>>5 packs of soda\nThe soda was on sale for $3.00 per 6 pack and he was buying 5 packs so 3*5 = $<<3*5=15.00>>15.00 for soda\n#### 15\n\nProblem:\nQ: Jacob is building ladders.

As he walked across the porch afterward, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind. How many dust particles were on the porch before Samuel swept if there were 331 after he walked across it?\nA: <INS>\nGround truth answer: Before Samuel walked across the porch, there were 331 - 223 = <<331-223=108>>108 dust particles.\nThose 108 were 1/10 of the original amount, so there were 108 * 10 = <<108*10=1080>>1080 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept.\n#### 1080\n\nProblem:\nQ: Alan went to the market and bought 20 eggs at the price of $2 per egg.

How much money did Alan spend at the market?\nA: <INS>\nGround truth answer: The cost of 20 eggs is 20 * $2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nThe cost of 6 chickens is 6 * $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nThe total amount Alan spent at the market is $40 + $48 = $<<40+48=88>>88.\n#### 88\n\nProblem:\nQ: Jenna is buying concert tickets for her group of five friends. She's able to get two of the tickets from the concert website for $50 each before they sell out. A scalper offers to sell her two more tickets for 240% of the normal price, but Jenna convinces him to give her $10 off that total payment. Finally, one of her friends gets a discounted ticket through her job for 60% of the normal price. How much do Jenna's friends pay for their tickets in total?\nA: <INS>\nGround truth answer: First calculate the price of the two normally priced tickets by multiplying the price and the quantity: $50 * 2 = $<<50*2=100>>100\nThen calculate the scalper's initial asking price by multiplying the normal cost of two tickets by 240%: $100 * 2.4 = $<<100*2.4=240>>240\nThen subtract the $10 discount Jenna negotiated: $240 - $10 = $<<240-10=230>>230\nNow calculate the price of the discounted ticket Jenna's friend gets through her job by multiplying the normal ticket price by 60%: $50 * .6 = $<<50*.6=30>>30\nFinally, add up the price of all the tickets to find the total: $100 + $230 + $30 = $<<100+230+30=360>>360\n#### 360\n\nGenerate an instruction that is different from all the instructions <INS> above, and has a higher score than all the instructions <INS> above.
