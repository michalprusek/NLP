How many dollars did Luca pay for his drink?\nA: <INS>\noutput:\n Luca’s coupon saved him 8 / 4 = $<<8/4=2>>2 on his sandwich.\nHe paid $1 for avocado on his sandwich, so the sandwich cost 8 - 2 + 1 = $<<8-2+1=7>>7.\nHe paid $3 for his salad, so his meal without the drink was 7 + 3 = $<<7+3=10>>10.\nThus, Luca paid 12 - 10 = $<<12-10=2>>2 for his drink.\n#### 2\n\ninput:\nQ: Tonya is buying Christmas gifts for her sisters.

How much did Marc spend in total?\nA: <INS>\noutput:\n The 5 model cars cost $20 x 5 = $<<20*5=100>>100.\nThe 5 bottles of paint cost $10 x 5 = $<<10*5=50>>50.\nThe 5 paint brushes cost $2 x 5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.\nThus, Marc spent $100 + $50 +$10 = $<<100+50+10=160>>160 in total.\n#### 160\n\ninput:\nQ: Mason has 3 cartons of 200 blueberries. He makes as many muffins as he can with 10 blueberries per muffin. Then he makes 60 cinnamon muffins. What percentage of all the muffins he made have blueberries?\nA: <INS>\noutput:\n First find the total number of blueberries Mason has: 200 blueberries/carton * 3 cartons = 600 blueberries\nThen divide the total number of blueberries by the number of blueberries per muffin: 600 blueberries / 10 blueberries/muffin = <<600/10=60>>60 muffins\nThen add that number of muffins to the number of cinnamon muffins to find the total number of muffins: 60 muffins + 60 muffins = <<60+60=120>>120 muffins\nThen divide the number of blueberry muffins by the total number of muffins and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 muffins / 120 muffins * 100% = 50%\n#### 50\n\ninput:\nQ: A hot dog stand sells 10 hot dogs every hour, each one selling for $2.  How many hours does the stand need to run to make $200 in sales?\nA: <INS>\noutput:\n First, we find out how much in sales the stand makes each hour by multiplying the number of hot dogs sold by the sales price, finding that 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 dollars in sales each hour.\nThen we divide the sales goal for the day by the sales per hour, finding that the stand needs to be open for 200/20= <<200/20=10>>10 hours to hit its sales goal.\n#### 10\n\nWrite your new text that is different from the old ones and has a score as high as possible.

Gary borrowed the money from his dad who said he could pay him back the full amount over 5 years.  Gary decided he would pay his dad back the full amount in 2 years.  How much more is Gary spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5?\nA: <INS>\noutput:\n A full year has 12 months. So 2 years is 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 months\nThe loan amount is $6,000 that he will repay in 24 months so 6000/24 = $<<6000/24=250>>250 per month\nIf he paid his dad back in 5 years that 5*12 = <<5*12=60>>60 months\n$6,000 loan spread out over 60 months is 6000/60 = $<<6000/60=100>>100 per month\nTo pay it off in 2 years instead of 5, Gary is paying 250-100 = $<<250-100=150>>150 more per month\n#### 150\n\ninput:\nQ: Trace has five shopping bags that weigh the same amount as Gordon’s two shopping bags. One of Gordon’s shopping bags weighs three pounds and the other weighs seven. Trace’s shopping bags all weigh the same amount.

Since 20% were damaged, we calculate the number of damaged apples as 20% of 180, which is 0.20 × 180 = <<0.20*180=36>>36 apples. Therefore, the number of undamaged apples available for sale is 180 apples - 36 apples = <<180-36=144>>144 apples.\n#### 144]",
