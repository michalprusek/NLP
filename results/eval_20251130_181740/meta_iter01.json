If pastries are sold for $2 and loaves of bread are sold for $4, what is the difference, in dollars, between the baker’s daily average and total for today?\nA: <INS>\noutput:\n The daily average sales of pastries amounts to 20 pastries * $2/pastry = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nThe daily average sales of bread amounts to 10 loaves of bread * $4/loaf = $<<10*4=40>>40.\nTherefore, the daily average is $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80.\nToday’s sales of pastries amounts to 14 pastries * $2/pastry = $<<14*2=28>>28.\nToday’s sales of loaves of bread amounts to 25 loaves of bread * $4/loaf = $<<25*4=100>>100.\nTherefore, today’s sales amount to $28 + $100 = $<<28+100=128>>128.\nThis means the total difference between today’s sales and the daily average is $128 – $80 = $<<128-80=48>>48.\n#### 48\n\ninput:\nQ: Kat decides she wants to start a boxing career.

Each batch requires 3 cups of flour and makes exactly 24 cookies. If the baker wants to ensure there are at least 150 cookies available, how many batches should they make?\nA: <INS>\noutput:\nEach batch makes 24 cookies. To find the minimum number of batches needed to reach 150 cookies, we divide 150 by 24: 150 / 24 = 6.25. Since partial batches don’t work in baking and the baker needs at least 150 cookies, we round up to the next whole number because the baker must meet or exceed the requirement. Thus, the baker needs to make 7 batches.\n#### 7\n]\nscore: 90",
