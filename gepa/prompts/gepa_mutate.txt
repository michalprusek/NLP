You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to improve a math problem-solving prompt based on analysis of its failures.

## Current Prompt
{current_prompt}

## Analysis of Failures
{reflection}

## High-Performing Reference Prompts (Pareto Front)
{pareto_prompts}

## Your Task

Generate {num_mutations} improved versions of the prompt that address the identified weaknesses.

Requirements:
- Each prompt should be self-contained and complete
- Focus on fixing the specific weaknesses identified
- You may incorporate successful patterns from the reference prompts
- Keep prompts concise but comprehensive (100-300 words)
- Each prompt should take a slightly different approach

Output exactly {num_mutations} prompts in this format:

<prompt_1>
[Your improved prompt here]
</prompt_1>

<prompt_2>
[Your improved prompt here]
</prompt_2>
