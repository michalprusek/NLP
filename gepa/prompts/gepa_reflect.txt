You are an expert prompt engineer analyzing failures in a math problem-solving system.

## Current Prompt Being Optimized
{current_prompt}

## Failed Examples with Reasoning Traces

{failure_traces}

## Your Task

Analyze these failures and provide:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: What common patterns or issues caused these failures?
   - Are there specific problem types that fail?
   - Is the reasoning approach flawed?
   - Are there calculation errors or misunderstandings?

2. **Specific Weaknesses**: List 2-3 concrete weaknesses in the current prompt.

3. **Improvement Suggestions**: For each weakness, suggest a specific fix.

Provide your analysis in the following format:

<analysis>
ROOT CAUSES:
- [cause 1]
- [cause 2]

WEAKNESSES:
1. [weakness]: [suggested fix]
2. [weakness]: [suggested fix]
3. [weakness]: [suggested fix]
</analysis>
