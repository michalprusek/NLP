That is 4 days * $20/day = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nNext, we calculate the cost based on the miles driven. The cost per mile is $0.15, and Sarah drove 150 miles, so 150 miles * $0.15/mile = $<<150*0.15=22.5>>22.5.\nAdding these two amounts together, the total cost is $80 + $22.5 = $<<80+22.5=102.5>>102.5.\n#### 102.5",
