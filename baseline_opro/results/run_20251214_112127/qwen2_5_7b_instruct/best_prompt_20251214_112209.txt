Q: A cyclist plans to cover a distance of 120 miles. He divides his journey into two parts such that the second part is twice the length of the first. Calculate the distance covered in each segment of the trip.

A: Let the distance of the first segment be \(x\) miles. Since the second segment is twice the length of the first, its distance is \(2x\) miles. Given that the total distance is 120 miles, we get \(x + 2x = 120\).

Solving the equation, we combine like terms: 

\(3x = 120\)

Dividing both sides by 3:

\(x = 40\)

Therefore, the distance covered in the first segment is 40 miles, and the distance covered in the second segment is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) miles.

output:
First segment: 40 miles, Second segment: 80 miles
